Package List Fetcher:

Reference: 
 * cran_root_directory: https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib
 * cran_packages_file: /PACKAGAGES
 * example packages file url: 
https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/PACKAGES
An example is in the doc directory, as PACKAGES
 * local_tmp_directory = /tmp 

- use gem down to provide robust file downloading using ruby.
- open primary CRAN Server url
- read contents

Option 1
- open local file (package_list.txt)
- save content
- write package_list_file_reader.rb
- from file contents, 

Option 2
- write straight to db; Package model.
disadvantage is that we could loose the package list, or have local db issues.
this approach feels too brittle. 

Lets pick option 1)

We can save packages locally in package_list.txt
I was thinking that pack_list_<date>.txt could be useful to store historical packages,
 but this would eventually fill the file system up with un-needed files. 
 If we need any previous pack_list's let us just have a .old file.
